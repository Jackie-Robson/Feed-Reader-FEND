# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was tasked with Writing a testing environment
for the application.



## What will I learn?

I have learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. they tested the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
